--- Original Description ---
Water, mud and marsh are friends. Take vantage of the terrain around you.
Add soils, roads, bridges, sliding floors and more.

CONTENT
� Soils: build overwater. Some are growable and placed indoor.
� Bridges: build overwater. Good to walk but deteriorate overtime.
� Roads: build overwater. Walk more efficiently.
� Foundations: build overwater. Set up for buildings.
� Slides: build over soils and floors. Increase the walk speed.
� Water: build over soils. Set up for terrains and slow down enemies.
  (obs: overwater = over water, mud and marsh in most cases.)

BALANCING
� Stuffs that rapidly deteriorate don't require much work or resources.
� Bad stuffs starts with tribal colonies and don't require much work or resources.
� The most part can't be removed but can be replaced (abuse of Primitive and Neutral soil).
� Automated stuffs don't need energy and aren't breakable.
� The pathCost of vanilla water, mud and marsh are slightly changed.

COMPATIBILITY
� Compatible with existent saves but may present inconsistencies with some floor mods.
  (example: be able to set some terrains in strange places).</description>
